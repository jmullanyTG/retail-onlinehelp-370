        <h1>Content Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Content Manager module.</p>
        <h2>Ability to restrict access to fields in a content version</h2>
        <p>You can now configure user and role-based privileges for specific content fields by content version. The privileges extend across master, promotion and event content.</p>
        <p>The Edit Content Version dialog box includes a new Access column that indicates whether there are edit restrictions in place for that field. A black user icon in the Access column indicates that all users are able to edit the field; a blue user icon indicates that the field is read-only to at least one role or user. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Double-clicking a user icon opens the Remove User Access dialog box, where you can choose which roles and users can edit the field and which cannot. </p>
