        <h1>Price Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Price Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Customizable pricing plan report or dashboard</h2>
        <p>You can now add a view collection set as a tab in Price Manager's pricing plan screen. Just point the new <a href=" System Policies.htm">Pricing Plan View Collection set system policy</a> to the view collection set you want to use as a dashboard or report. When a pricing plan is open in Price Manager, a new tab with the name of the configured view collection set appears.</p>
