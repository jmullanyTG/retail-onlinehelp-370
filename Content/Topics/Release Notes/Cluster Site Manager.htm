        <h1>Cluster Site Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancement is now available in the Cluster Site Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Multi-select option for snapshot and calculate cluster set actions</h2>
        <p>The Allow Multiple toolbar option has been extended to Snapshot and Calculate actions, making it much easier to create snapshots of multiple cluster sets at once and calculate multiple cluster sets at once. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cluster Site Manager/RN multi.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When the Allow Multiple toolbar option is enabled, you can select multiple cluster sets and/or cluster set partitions in the grid and then click <b>Delete</b>,<b> Snapshot</b>, or <b>Calculate</b> to perform the action on all of the selected cluster sets. 
                        </p>
        <p><b>Notes</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting a cluster set partition automatically selects all of its cluster sets.</li>
            <li>Multi-cluster set operations may be submitted as tasks to the <a href="../Workload Queue Manager/Workload Queue Overview.htm">workload queue</a>. You will receive a notification once the operations are done.</li>
        </ul>
