        <h1>Site Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Site Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Transportation Schedules</h2>
        <p>You can now define a default transportation schedule for a store or DC. Transportation schedules set the dates on which transportation of stock to a store or DC is available ("truck" schedules, etc.). When calculating lead times for shipments to a receiving site, JustEnough uses the destination site's transportation schedule to determine what days transportation to the destination site is available. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Note: <span style="font-weight: normal;">If transportation schedules are defined at both the site and inventory levels, the inventory-level schedule takes precedence.</span></p>
