        <h1>Workflow Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancement is now available in the Workflow Manager module. </p>
        <h2>New diagram-based UI</h2>
        <p>A new, friendlier interface simplifies the process of creating and maintaining workflows. You can now add workflow steps and connections to a canvas and customize settings from clearly laid-out side panels, making it much easier to understand and configure your workflows.</p>

        <p>Existing workflows are automatically migrated to the new format.</p>
