        <h1>Promotion Manager</h1>
        <p>The following promotion-related enhancements are now available.</p>
        <h2>Configuration Migration utility</h2>
        <p>A new utility lets you migrate promotion-related configurations between QA, UAT, and production environments from within the JustEnough application. Previously, such migrations were done manually, which was a time-intensive and error-prone process. Now, what used to take days or weeks now takes only minutes to complete.</p>
