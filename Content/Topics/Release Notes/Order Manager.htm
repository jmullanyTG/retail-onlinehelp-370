        <h1>Order Manager</h1>
        <p>The following Order Manager enhancement is now available.</p>
        <h2>API for Exporting Orders</h2>
        <p>A new API is available that standardizes the exports of orders from JustEnough to external systems. The API&#160;includes a standard table and processes and is anticipated to dramatically ease the process of integrating JustEnough with other systems, such as Mi9 Merchant. </p>
