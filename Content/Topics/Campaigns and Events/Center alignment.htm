        <h1 class="Heading3">Center alignment</h1>
        <p>A container may be center aligned, horizontally as well as vertically, in the parent container.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>This setting has a similar effect to the previous alignment settings, except that the expansion or shrinking takes place from the center of the parent container.&#160; The larger the content, the more it will expand regardless of the size of the item being configured.&#160; </p>
