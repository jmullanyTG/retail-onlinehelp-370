        <h1 class="Heading3">Top, bottom, left or right alignment</h1>
        <p>A container may be aligned to the left or right, as well as to the top or bottom of the parent container, i.e. the item is being laid out.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Concepts terminology.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 184px;height: 72px;" />
        </p>
        <p>If the container size is not sufficient for the contents, then the container will continue to stretch in the direction opposite to the docking alignment to accommodate the content. For example, if the container is aligned to the top left, it will stretch to the right and bottom to fit the content. It will expand beyond the parent container if necessary. Any other containers that were adjacent to the right or bottom will get pushed out of the parent container, regardless of their alignment properties. Alternatively, if the content takes up less space than the container size, the container will shrink to fit the content. This type of unconstrained container should only be used for very brief text or Images of a fixed size that will not cause a problem.</p>
