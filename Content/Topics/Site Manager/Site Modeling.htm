        <h1 >Site Modeling</h1>
        <p>Site modeling allows users to select sites for supersession functionality, similar to inventory supersessions. It may also be used to create modeling for new sites based on product levels. Item (inventory level) supersessions and site model quantities will be combined when calculating history for the purposes of demand forecasting. </p>
        <h2 >Site Model Options</h2>
        <p>Site model options functions as the “header” for the supersession/model. Users may select the start and end dates of the model, as well as its active status. </p>
