        <h1>Demand Transfer Overview</h1>
        <p>A challenge for omni-channel retailers is ensuring that their replenishment strategies keep up with the options shoppers now have when it comes to fulfilling their purchases. These options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy Online, Pickup In Store</li>
            <li>Buy Online, Ship to Home</li>
            <li>Buy In Store, Ship to Home</li>
            <li>Buy In Store, Pickup in a Different Store</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each option results in inventory potentially leaving a different site than where it was sold. When this happens, the demand for items is transferred from the sales location to the fulfillment location.</p>
        <p>If your replenishment strategy does not account for these demand transfers,  "bad" outcomes (such as overstocks, understocks, lost sales, and costly inventory re-orders and redistributions) can occur.</p>
        <p>To help you avoid these outcomes, the demand transfer feature lets you choose whether your items use <i>fulfillment-driven</i> replenishment strategies or the traditional sales-driven replenishment strategy.</p>
        <h2>Sales-driven replenishment</h2>
        <p>In a traditional retail scenario, sales and fulfillment are assumed to happen at the same location. A typical example would be a customer walking into a store, taking an item off of the shelf, purchasing it at the register, and taking it with them as they walk out of the store.</p>
        <p>In such scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demand for an item remains at its sale location.</li>
            <li>Future replenishment orders for a store are based on that store's forecasted <i>sales demand</i>. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is sales demand?</h3>
        <p>Sales demand is a type of forecast that predicts future demand for items at a location based on historical <b>sales</b> at that location. </p>
        <p>You can create different types of sales demand forecasts from within Demand Management modules, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory, level, group, and shape forecasts generated by the <a href="../Demand Forecasting/Demand Forecasting Overview.htm">Demand Forecasting</a> module.</li>
            <li>Profiles generated by the <a href="../Profiles/Profiles Overview.htm">Profiles</a> module.</li>
            <li>Rates of sale generated by the <a href="../Rate of Sale Calculator/Rate of Sale Calculator Overview.htm">Rate of Sale</a> module.</li>
            <li>Allocations forecasts generated by the <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Overview.htm">Allocation</a> module.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fulfillment-driven replenishment</h2>
        <p>In omni-channel scenarios, sales and fulfillment can happen at different locations. </p>
        <p>For example, in a “buy online, pick up in store” (BOPIS) scenario, a shopper buys something online and then gets to choose the brick-and-mortar store where they will pick up their purchases.  </p>
        <p>In these scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demand for an item is transferred from the sales location to the fulfillment location.</li>
            <li>Future replenishment orders for a store should be based on that store's forecasted <i>fulfillment demand</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="What"></a>What is fulfillment demand?</h3>
        <p>Fulfillment demand is a type of forecast that predicts future demand for items at a location based on historic <b>fulfillment</b> at that location.</p>
        <p>The following types of fulfillment demand forecasts can be generated by Demand Management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Split Factor Method Overview.htm">Split factor</a> forecasts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Choosing an item's replenishment strategy</h2>
        <p>By default, Demand Management uses a location's projected sales demand to replenishment orders at at a location. You can switch to using fulfillment demand instead on an item-by-item basis.</p>
        <p>To replenish an item based on fulfillment demand, see <a href="Demand Transfer Configuration.htm#_Demand_Transfer_Configuration"><span class="Hyperlink">Demand Transfer Configuration.</span></a></p>
        <p><b>Note</b>:&#160;For best results, use the same replenishment strategy for all locations where an item is sold.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
