        <p>How shipping and receiving schedules are applied to both stores and DCs will affect ordering behavior in different ways.

            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Receiving Schedule – </span>The receiving schedule determines the dates on which a store or DC may receive stock. This may be set to ensure busy stores receive stock shipments during times with less foot traffic, or when staff is available for processing. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shipping Schedule –</span> Shipping schedules will determine the dates on which an order may be placed against a store or DC. It is assumed that any location is able to ship on the same day as an order may be placed. In cases where there is a lag in time between order placement and actual shipping of goods, an additional day should be added to the lead time to represent this lag. </li>
